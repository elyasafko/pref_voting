# Example Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the `pref_voting` package.  

* [election_types.ipynb](election_types.ipynb): An overview of the type of elections in `pref_voting`.  This and [collective_decision_procedures.ipynb](collective_decision_procedures.ipynb) are good starting points to understand the pref_voting package. 

* [collective_decision_procedures.ipynb](collective_decision_procedures.ipynb): An overview of the voting methods, probabilistic voting methods, and social welfare functions that are implemented in pref_voting. This and [election_types.ipynb](election_types.ipynb)  are good starting points to understand the pref_voting package. 

* [pref_voting_overview.ipynb](pref_voting_overview.ipynb): An overview of the `pref_voting` package, including how to generate profiles, analyze profiles, and use voting methods.  This notebook was created to accompany a talk about pref_voting (see the [slides](pref_voting_talk.pdf) for the talk).

* [condorcet_efficiency.ipynb](condorcet_efficiency.ipynb): Discusses how to use pref_voting to find the Condorcet efficiency of various voting methods.
